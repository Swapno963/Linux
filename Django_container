1. Avoid Using sudo
Running Docker with sudo isn't ideal for security and convenience. Instead, add your user to the docker group so you don't need to use sudo:

bash
Copy code
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
After running this command, log out and log back in to apply the changes. Then, you can simply run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build



4. Remove Unused Resources Before Building
Clean up unused Docker resources (e.g., old images, containers) before running the build:

bash
Copy code
docker system prune -f
docker-compose up --build
